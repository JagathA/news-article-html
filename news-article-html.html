            <h2>Handy tips on how to create accessible websites for everyone</h2>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                Tim Berners Lee dreamt of a World Wide Web that would be free and
                accessible to everyone. Sadly, the modern web is littered with poorly
                designed websites and difficult to navigate code (for both developers
                and users). This often comes down to a lack of understanding around
                different user needs. Designing pages that are accessible for everyone
                shouldn’t be too difficult. The developers at Tech Returners News have
                collated an ‘easy wins' checklist for Web page accessibility.
                <br>
                Keep this guide handy... When creating your own websites you can check
                these criteria off the list!

            <section>
                <h2>Accessibility Checks:</h2>
                <p>
                    elements & Page Titles: HTML heading elements have been used to
                    represent page structure, supporting assistive technologies that
                    allow page navigation from heading to heading.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Re-size Text: You can vary text size by using your browser's text
                    resize settings (through Options or Preferences), text-only zoom,
                    page zoom (which also zooms images, buttons etc) without incurring
                    styling issues / text over-lapping or being cut off the page.
                    Alternative text for images: All images have been given appropriate
                    alternative text.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Link text: All hyperlinks should make sense when read out of
                    context, and hyperlinks are clearly presented in a different text
                    style from normal body text. If a link opens in a new browser page,
                    it has been labelled as doing so.
                </p>

                <p>
                    JavaScript independence: Where JavaScript or other scripts are used
                    for navigation or functionality, an alternative mechanism has been
                    put in place in case your browser does not support these scripts.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Colour contrast: has been checked for text and background colour
                    combinations to ensure that the contrast is sufficient and I have
                    also ensured that information is not referenced by colour alone.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Style sheets: If style sheets are not supported or are turned off,
                    information on the site can still be accessed and read. Forms: forms
                    are marked up correctly so people can interact with them using only
                    the keyboard, voice input or screen readers. The form labels
                    themselves are clickable, increasing the target area and making it
                    easier to select small radio buttons of checkboxes.
                </p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    By spending just a little more time on getting the building blocks
                    of the web right, developers can help create an Internet that works
                    for ever yone.
